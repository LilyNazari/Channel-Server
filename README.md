# Chat Server and Client

This repository contains the source code for a real-time chat application with a focus on art history discussions. The system is divided into two primary components:

Backend (Flask Server): Handles message exchange, channel management, user authentication, and feedback generation based on chat content.
Frontend (React App): Provides a user interface for chatting, displaying messages, and interacting with the server.
The backend and frontend are both integrated to work together seamlessly. The backend also supports AI-based message feedback and content moderation such as off-topic detection and profanity filtering.

## Features
Backend:
Channel Management: Registers and manages channels dynamically through the Hub.
User Authentication: Handles user management and login with Flask-Login.
Profanity Filtering: Messages are screened for inappropriate content using the better_profanity package.
Off-Topic Detection: An AI model based on Naive Bayes detects if a message is off-topic (e.g., not related to art history).
Feedback Generation: The server generates informative and random feedback about art, history, and artists based on chat messages.
Frontend:
Username Management: Users can set their username and itâ€™s stored in localStorage.
Real-Time Messaging: Users can send and receive messages in real-time.
Search Functionality: Allows users to search through the chat messages.
Unread Message Counter: Tracks the number of unread messages.
